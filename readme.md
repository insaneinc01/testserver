HOW TO RUN

- git clone https://github.com/insaneinc01/testserver.git
- cd testserver
- npm install
- node index.js

Once the server starts, it connects to MongoDB server that is hosted remotely on Mongo Atlas

Idea
- Build a bare-bones graphql server to power a bare-bones ecommerce website
- Apollo server for quickly getting up and running
- Database - MongoDb
- Instead of setting up Mongo locally, think about using a ready made service?
- Mongo Atlas - overkill!? Find simpler and free optons...
- Setup basic queries - Categories, Products, Featured-products?
- Setup basic mutations - Add Category, Add Product, Make a product 'featured'
- Basic authentication for admin
- Use Fakerjs to populate sample data for products
